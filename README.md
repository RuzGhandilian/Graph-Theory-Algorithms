# Graph Theory Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of various graph theory algorithms as part of my **Graph Theory** class at **NPUA**. The goal of this project is to implement and demonstrate important algorithms such as **DFS**, **BFS**, **Topological Sorting**, **Dijkstra's**, **Bellman-Ford**, and others, using **NetworkX** for graph handling and **Matplotlib** for visualization where applicable.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following graph theory algorithms are implemented in this repository:

1. **[DFS (Depth-First Search)](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/dfs)**  
   Implements DFS with optional visualization for graph traversal.
   
2. **[BFS (Breadth-First Search)](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/bfs)**  
   Implements BFS with optional visualization for graph traversal.

3. **[Dungeon Problem on Grids](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/dungeon_problem)**  
   A grid-based pathfinding problem solved using graph theory concepts.

4. **[Connected Components](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/connected_components)**  
   Uses DFS to find connected components in an undirected graph.

5. **[Topological Sorting](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/topological_sort)**  
   Implements topological sorting on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

6. **[Dijkstra’s Algorithm](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/dijkstra)**  
   Implements Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs.

7. **[Bellman-Ford Algorithm](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/bellman_ford)**  
   Implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which handles graphs with negative weights.

8. **[Floyd-Warshall Algorithm](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/floyd_warshall)**  
   Implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.

9. **[Longest Path on DAG](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/longest_path_dag)**  
   Solves the longest path problem in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using dynamic programming and topological sorting.

9. **[Kahn’s Algorithm](https://github.com/RuzGhandilian/Graph-Theory-Algorithms/tree/main/src/kahns_algorithm)**
   Implements Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting of DAGs using in-degree tracking and a queue. Detects cycles by checking if all nodes are processed.
